# miniapps_github
Here are three files for running the miniapps. The run_jobs.sh script submits the jobs to your HPC system. You'll need to modify the job submission script according to your specific HPC environment. Verify whether your system uses Apptainer or Singularity containers and update the script accordingly if necessary.
```
sbatch run_jobs.sh

```
